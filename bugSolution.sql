The issue is resolved by adding a correlation clause to the subquery, explicitly linking it to the outer query. This ensures that each row in the outer query is compared against the corresponding row(s) in the subquery based on a common column.  For instance, if the outer query uses a `customerID`, the subquery should also use `customerID` to filter its results appropriately for each outer query customer. The corrected query ensures that the comparison is made correctly for each row from the outer query, preventing ambiguity and producing accurate results.
